## SOC Design Flow

<div>
  <img src="./assets/SOC_Design_Flow.png" alt="SOC Design Flow" width="80%">
</div>

The above image illustrates the comprehensive System on Chip (SoC) Design Flow, a multi-stage process for developing integrated circuits that combine various components of a computer system onto a single chip. The flow can be broadly categorized into Front-End Design, Software Development, and Physical Design (Back-End), culminating in manufacturing and post-silicon validation. 
SoC Design Flow Stages:

1. SoC Specification
  - The process begins by defining the intended functionality, performance goals, power constraints, and physical dimensions of the chip based on the target application. 

2. Architecture Design (Hardware/Software Partitioning)
  - A high-level architecture of the chip is developed, outlining the key functional blocks, their interconnections, and the partitioning of functions between hardware and software components. 

3. Software Development (Parallel Track)
  - High-Level Modeling: Abstract algorithmic descriptions of hardware components are created, often in languages like C or SystemC.
  - Software Development: The software components are developed in parallel with hardware design, including drivers, firmware, and application software.
  - HW/SW Co-simulation: Hardware and software components are simulated together to ensure they function correctly and verify the hardware/software interfaces.
  - Software Testing and Refinement: Rigorous testing and debugging of the software on virtual prototypes or emulation platforms ensure its correctness and compatibility with the hardware.
  - Final Code: The optimized and validated software code is prepared for integration with the hardware. 

4. Front-End Design
  - RTL Design: The architecture is translated into a Register Transfer Level (RTL) representation using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL, describing the data flow and control logic.
  - Functional Simulation and Verification: Extensive simulations and verifications are performed on the RTL code to ensure functional correctness and identify design flaws.
  - RTL Synthesis and DFT: The RTL design is converted into a gate-level netlist, which is a description of the circuit in terms of logic gates and their interconnections. Design For Testability (DFT) logic is also inserted to facilitate post-fabrication testing.
  - Gate Level Netlist: The output of synthesis, a detailed description of the circuit using standard logic cells. 

5. Physical Design (Back-End)
  - Place and Route: Standard cells (logic gates) are placed on the chip, and interconnections (routing) between them are created to meet timing, power, and area constraints.
  - Timing Verification and Signoff: Static Timing Analysis (STA) is performed to verify that the design meets all timing requirements and constraints.
  - Physical Verification: Checks like Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) are performed to ensure the physical layout adheres to manufacturing rules and matches the logical design.
  - Design GDSII: The final layout data in Graphic Data System II (GDSII) format, which is sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. 

6. Manufacturing
  - The GDSII data is used to fabricate the physical chip on silicon wafers in a semiconductor foundry. 

7. Post-Silicon Validation and Integration
  - After manufacturing, the fabricated chips are tested and validated in a real-world environment to ensure they meet all functional and performance specifications. 

8. Mass Production
  - Once validated, the chips proceed to mass production to be integrated into target devices.

  - Can multiply or divide frequencies as needed.
- **Block Diagram:**

<div align="center" >
  <img src="./assets/PLL_Diagram.png" alt="PLL_Diagram" width="70%">
</div>

- **Components:**
  - **Phase Detector:** Compares input and output signals, generating an error signal.
  - **Loop Filter:** Processes the error signal to produce a control voltage.
  - **VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator):** Adjusts frequency based on the control voltage.

### DAC: Digital-to-Analog Converter
- **Role:** Converts digital data from the CPU into analog signals.
- **Features:**
  - 10-bit resolution for high-quality output.
  - Outputs analog signals to external devices (e.g., speakers, displays).
  - Supports real-world applications like audio/video generation.
- **Types of DACs:**
  - **Weighted Resistor DAC:** Uses resistors of different values for each bit.
  - **R-2R Ladder DAC:** Uses a network of resistors for simpler design and scaling.

### **1. Binary Weighted Resistor DAC**

#### **Overview**
The **Binary Weighted Resistor DAC** converts a digital input (binary code) into an analog voltage output using resistors whose values are weighted in powers of two. Each bit of the digital input controls a switch that connects the corresponding resistor to a reference voltage or ground.

#### **Circuit Diagram**

<div align="center" >
  <img src="./assets/BinaryWeightedDAC.png" alt="BinaryWeightedDAC" width="70%">
</div>

#### **Working Principle**
- Each bit of the digital input is connected to a resistor whose value is twice that of the next lower bit.
- The most significant bit (MSB) uses the smallest resistor, and the least significant bit (LSB) uses the largest.
- The output voltage is the sum of the voltages contributed by each bit, weighted by the resistor values.

#### **Advantages**
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Fast conversion due to direct resistor network.

#### **Disadvantages**
- Requires a wide range of resistor values, which can be impractical for high-resolution DACs.
- More expensive and less scalable for higher bit counts.

---

### **2. R-2R Ladder DAC**

#### **Overview**
The **R-2R Ladder DAC** is a popular type of DAC that uses only two resistor values (R and 2R) arranged in a ladder network. This design simplifies the circuit and makes it easier to scale for higher resolutions.

#### **Circuit Diagram**

<div align="center" >
  <img src="./assets/R2RLadderDAC.png" alt="R2RLadderDAC" width="70%">
</div>

#### **Working Principle**
- The ladder network is constructed using resistors of values R and 2R.
- Each bit of the digital input controls a switch that connects the corresponding node to either the reference voltage or ground.
- The equivalent resistance seen by each node is always 2R, regardless of the number of bits, due to the ladder’s recursive structure.
- The output voltage is the sum of the voltages contributed by each bit, weighted by the ladder network.

#### **Advantages**
- Uses only two resistor values, making it easier and cheaper to manufacture.
- Highly scalable for higher bit counts.
- More practical for integrated circuit implementation.

#### **Disadvantages**
- Slightly more complex to analyze and design compared to the binary weighted DAC.
- Requires precise resistor matching for accurate conversion.

#### **Formula**
The output voltage `V_out` is given by:

`V_out = -V_ref * (b0/2^1 + b1/2^2 + b2/2^3 + ... + b(n-1)/2^n)`

where:
- `V_ref` is the reference voltage,
- `b0, b1, ..., b(n-1)` are the bits of the digital input (0 or 1),
- `n` is the number of bits.

## How VSD Baby SOC Works

### Initialization and Clock Generation
1. On power-up, the PLL is activated.
2. The PLL locks onto the reference clock and generates a stable, synchronized clock signal.
3. This clock signal is distributed to the RVMYTH CPU and DAC, ensuring all components operate in sync.

### Data Processing in RVMYTH
1. The RVMYTH CPU executes instructions and processes data.
2. The `r17` register is used to hold and cycle through values destined for the DAC.
3. As the CPU runs, it updates `r17` with new data, preparing it for analog conversion.

### Analog Signal Generation via DAC
1. The DAC receives digital values from the RVMYTH CPU.
2. It converts these values into an analog signal.
3. The analog output is saved to a file (`OUT`) and can be sent to external devices (e.g., TVs, mobile phones) for further processing or display.

## Why Use a PLL?

| Issue                     | Impact                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clock Distribution Delays** | Long wiring can introduce delays, affecting timing.                   |
| **Clock Jitter**          | Variations in signal timing can disrupt synchronization.               |
| **Different Frequency Needs** | Different SoC blocks may require different clock frequencies.       |
| **Crystal Frequency Errors** | Crystals can drift with temperature and age, affecting accuracy.      |
| **Frequency Stability**   | Higher ppm errors mean more frequency variation with temperature.     |

**Solution:** The PLL provides a stable, adjustable clock signal, ensuring reliable operation across the SoC.
